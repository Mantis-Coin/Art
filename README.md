# MANTIS Art Repository

Welcome to the official art repository for the MANTIS project.

This space is dedicated to the development, remixing, and curation of visual assets that bring the MANTIS universe to life. It is open to all creators who wish to contribute while respecting the visual integrity of the original character.

## ðŸ“Œ Core Principles

* **Consistency**: All contributions must use the official Mantis character and existing source materials.
* **Community-Driven**: Anyone can contribute, remix, or reinterpret assets â€” as long as the original spirit of the project is preserved.
* **Recognition & Rewards**: Contributions selected for publication will be rewarded. All rewards are funded by the MANTIS Treasury.

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure

### `/source/`

Official source files created by the core team, including .aseprite, layered sprites, and base designs. These files serve as the foundation for all creative work.

### `/proposed/`

Community-submitted works based on source assets.

* Each artist must create a subfolder using their handle (e.g., `@artname`).
* Include your remixed files (.png, .gif, .aseprite).
* Also include a short description of the purpose of your work (e.g., "for X banner", "Telegram sticker", "game item").

### `/requests/`

Open briefs and creative prompts from the core team and community. These are suggestions for what the community would love to see.

### `/published/`

Final approved and curated works that have been selected for official use â€” in game, media, or promotion. Authors are credited.

## ðŸŽ¨ Want to Join?

Start by forking the repository and browsing the `source` or `requests` folders. When you're ready, create your own submission in `proposed/` and open a pull request.

## ðŸ’° Treasury-Powered Rewards

Contributions selected for publication will be eligible for on-chain rewards, funded directly by the MANTIS Treasury. Our goal is to nurture a community of creators around a consistent visual universe.

Let your creativity swarm and help shape the face of MANTIS!

With claws,

**The MANTIS Team**
