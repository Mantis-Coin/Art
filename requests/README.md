# Requests

This folder contains art requests and creative prompts from the core team or Mantis community.

Anyone is welcome to pick a request and create a visual interpretation.

Each request includes a short brief or visual reference. When submitting, mention which request you're responding to in your pull request title or folder name.

⚠️ It is strongly required to use the original image of the Mantis character when working on requests, to ensure consistency of the core identity.
