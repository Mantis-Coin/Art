Concept Release Scene

Base Scene:

Lair interior, desk with old CRT computer, stacks of papers, WAGMI mug.

Outside: jungle + Aztec-style pyramid + mountains.

Mantis at desk, head toward monitor, claw typing.

Sequence

1. Typing

Mantis types slowly with pauses.

Text scrolls on screen (fills, then new screen).

Bird flies in background.

2. Lights Out

Lair darkens, monitor glow remains.

Lightning flashes: brief monochrome room + text keeps scrolling.

After last strike, monitor powers off.

3. After Strike

Light returns, mantis gone.

Monitor off, faint smoke rising slowly.

Single paper drifts down onto desk (slower fall).

4. Desk Close-Up

Focus on desk: WAGMI mug, scattered/crumbled papers.

Top paper shows GAME CONCEPT (or CONCEPT).

Notes:

Keep pixel art consistent with repo assets.

Slow pacing: typing + paper falling extended for drama.

Smoke should rise slowly, clear itâ€™s from PC, not mug.
