Treasury II

Base Scene:
Clearing in the jungle, large stone altar/platform with an open treasure chest overflowing with coins (the treasury).
Background: mountains and jungle canopy under a clear sky with clouds.
Foreground: mantises of different sizes (big and small) already positioned around the altar, each continuously donating coins.
Flying mantises in the sky above, circling steadily.

Sequence:
1. Endlessly Donating
Mantises remain in fixed positions, endlessly placing coins into the chest.
Coins vanish/reset smoothly from chest into their claws, making the act of donation appear infinite.
Chest maintains a steady "overflowing" state.

2. Flying Swarm Loop
Flying mantises in the sky repeat a smooth circular path, keeping motion continuous and natural.
Ground mantises remain static except for the endless coin motion.

3. Cyclical Loop
Scene designed for perfect repetition: donations cycle seamlessly, swarm in sky loops continuously, no gathering or dispersing.

Notes:
Pixel art style consistent with repo assets.
Focus on natural looping of donations and swarm flight.
No new mantises entering or leaving — all are already in place.
Ensure chest doesn’t “overfill” but stays lively with coin animations.
